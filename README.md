# 🐍 99 Haskell Problems 🐍

Welcome to my journey through the **99 Haskell Problems**! This repository contains my solutions to the famous [99 Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), a collection of problems designed to help you get better acquainted with the Haskell programming language.

## 🚀 Objective

The main goal of this repository is not to create the most efficient or optimized solutions but to explore and remember the unique characteristics of Haskell. This is a learning experience aimed at deepening my understanding of functional programming and Haskell's powerful features.

## 📚 Problems Covered

The problems are divided into different categories:
1. **Lists**
2. **Arithmetic**
3. **Logic and Codes**
4. **Binary Trees**
5. **Multiway Trees**
6. **Graphs**
7. **Miscellaneous**

## 📝 Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions provided here are for educational purposes. They may not be the most efficient or idiomatic Haskell code. The aim is to practice and understand the concepts rather than to achieve the best performance.

Happy Haskell Hacking! 🎉
